I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at [Singapore Management University](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/sfcheng/), under the supervision of Prof. [Shih-Fen Cheng](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/sfcheng/). I hold a Master's degree in Management Science and Engineering from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/index.htm#) (2020) and a Bachelor's degree in Information Management and Information Systems from [Nanjing Agricultural University](https://english.njau.edu.cn/mainm.htm) (2017).

Currently, I am interning at the [Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r), where I am collaborating with Dr. [Pavitra Krishnaswamy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hlN6yqkAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Aung Aye Phyu Phyu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CGf-zXkAAAAJ&hl=en). My work focuses on data-driven treatment optimization in healthcare, integrating machine learning techniques with clinical data to enhance personalized treatment strategies.

## Research Interests 📚

My research interests lie at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Optimization, with a particular focus on:

* Last-Mile Delivery Optimization
* Imitation Learning
* Healthcare Analytics and Treatment Optimization
* Machine Learning Applications in Real-world Systems
* Dynamic Pricing and Revenue Management
