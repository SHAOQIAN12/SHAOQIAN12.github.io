title: "Imitating Cost Constrained Behaviors in Reinforcement Learning"
collection: 34th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2024)
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This research explores imitation learning in scenarios where expert behavior is influenced by both rewards and constraints, introducing methods such as Lagrangian, meta-gradient, and cost violation-based approaches to address trajectory cost constraints, with empirical results showing that the meta-gradient-based approach outperforms existing methods in accurately imitating cost-constrained behaviors.'
